/* start with a grid of roughly 50 numbers in order from least to greatest
have a score box that when the program starts is set to a value of 10
the program at start is to pick a random number on the grid as the 0 value
nest the user can pick a number with thier mouse clicked
if the number is lower then 0 value the program will say "higher" and subtract 1 point from the score
if the number is higher then 0 value the program will say "lower" and subtract 1 point from the score
if the 0 value is chosen and clicked the program will say "congratulations" and give the option to restart the program
if you fail to guess 0 value in 10 tries (your score is set to 0) the program will highlight the correct number and say "please try again"\
