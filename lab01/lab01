My name Is John Paul Downham
My major is currently computer science however I belive it will change eventually. 
I'm in this class to further my understanding of programming
My current experiance with programming is from CSCI 4 and is based on processing JS
I want to build games from the ground up and am taking classes in order to accomplish that goal.
